The Dignity Baseline Framework
Notes on Consent, Harm, and Legitimate Power
Status
This document is a descriptive framework, not a manifesto or movement.
It proposes a way to evaluate systems, institutions, and policies based on minimum legitimacy constraints.
This framework has no authoritative interpreter.
It may be used, modified, criticized, or discarded without attribution.

1. Core Premise
All social systems require coordination.
Coordination always involves power.
This framework asks a narrow question:
Under what conditions is power legitimate?
The Dignity Baseline Framework proposes that power is legitimate only insofar as it preserves human dignity, protects consent, and prevents harm—especially under strain.

2. The Dignity Baseline
Dignity refers to a person’s right to exist without being coerced, degraded, or instrumentalized to meet others’ needs.
The baseline claim is simple:
Dignity must not be conditional on productivity, obedience, contribution, or moral conformity.
Systems that require suffering to prove worth rely on coercion, whether explicit or implicit.

3. Consent as a Structural Requirement
Consent is not a personal preference; it is a structural condition.
Valid consent requires:
1. Capacity (the ability to understand the choice)
2. Information (access to relevant facts in usable form)
3. Voluntariness (freedom from coercion, threat, or desperation)
4. Reversibility (the ability to withdraw without retaliation)
When any of these are missing, apparent agreement may be manufactured consent, not genuine choice.
Manufactured consent commonly arises through:
survival dependence
lack of exit options
social or economic pressure
time urgency
information asymmetry
A system that relies on manufactured consent is not fully legitimate, even if participation appears voluntary.

4. Harm as the Primary Boundary
This framework defines harm narrowly to avoid moral overreach.
Harm is an action or pattern that materially or psychologically reduces another person’s agency, safety, or bodily integrity without their consent.
Harm includes:
physical injury or threat
sexual coercion
persistent psychological intimidation
deprivation of access to basic needs
confinement or exclusion without consent
sabotage of shared life-support systems
Harm does not include:
non-participation
withdrawal
uneven contribution
emotional disappointment
refusal to help
apathy or disengagement
The framework intentionally protects non-contribution to prevent coercive moralization.

5. Legitimacy Under Strain
Most systems appear acceptable under ideal conditions.
Legitimacy must therefore be evaluated under stress.
A system fails the dignity baseline if, when strained, it:
reintroduces suffering as a condition of belonging
imposes obligation retroactively
moralizes exhaustion or incapacity
punishes withdrawal rather than adapting structure
concentrates power without review or sunset
A system maintains legitimacy when it responds to strain by:
reducing expectations
redistributing load
redesigning processes
increasing buffers or automation
preserving exit rights

6. Power Constraints
Power cannot be eliminated, but it can be constrained.
Legitimate power must be:
temporary
visible
limited in scope
revocable
accountable to those affected
No individual, role, or institution may claim permanent interpretive authority over this framework.

7. Scope and Limits
This framework:
does not prescribe a specific economic system
does not require belief or participation
does not define a moral ideal of the “good life”
does not promise harmony or abundance
It is compatible with:
markets
public provision
automation
mixed systems
plural cultural values
Its function is diagnostic, not salvational.

8. Failure Clause
If this framework is used to:
enforce conformity
demand sacrifice
suppress dissent
elevate moral authority
justify exclusion
…it has been misapplied and should be abandoned.

Summary Test
When evaluating a system, policy, or institution, ask:
1. Is dignity unconditional?
2. Is consent structurally protected?
3. Is harm clearly bounded?
4. Is power constrained and reversible?
5. Does the system adapt under strain, or punish individuals?
If the answer is no, legitimacy is compromised.
